In the fourth lab of the course, I was assigned to solve circuits using thevenin theorem, which involves in simplifying a complex circuit into a
single voltage course, resistor, and load. This involved calculaingwhat the equivalent total voltage supply was, and what the equivalent
resistance of the circuit was. These screenshots show how these measurements were made through multisim.
